2. Add your API keys to the `.env` file:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   IMAGEN_API_KEY=your_imagen_api_key_here
   ```

3. Replace the mock functions in `server.js` with actual API calls

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
